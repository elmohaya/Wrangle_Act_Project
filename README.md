# Wrangle_Act_Project

## INTRODUCTION
In this project we go over the process of data analysis. The process begins with gathering data which can be manually or programmatically. Assessing part comes after that to understand the data sets in terms of quality and tidiness.

Quality conditions are:

> 1- Completnece

> 2- Validity

> 3- Accurecy

> 4- Consistency

Tidiness charactaristics are:

> 1- Every variable is a column

> 2- Every Observation is a row

> 3- Every Observational unit is a table

Through this project, we will be detecting eight quality issues and 2 tidiness problems and correct them. the main objective of this project is to follow the smooth process of analyzing data. Therfore, let us begin.
